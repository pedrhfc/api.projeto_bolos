Literally translated from French as ‘a thousand leaves’, traditional mille-feuilles feature three layers of wafer thin puff pastry, interspersed with lashings of cream and topped with a dusting of icing sugar or fondant. The original mille-feuille recipe is reported to have been first referenced in François Pierre La Varenne’s 1651 cookery book, although Italy and Hungary also claim to have contributed towards its creation. No matter where the original mille-feuille may have stemmed from, today it is most certainly established as an icon in the world of French dessert recipes.
